# Wallpapers

These are all the wallpapers I have collected.

I try to keep this repo up to date.

## Notes

This repository is _kinda_ big at around >1.39 GBs. (checked at Dec 28, 2023)

If you clone this repo with bad WiFi, start praying to god if there is one.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers.git
```

Alternatively, you can [download this repository as a `.zip` file](https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and then extract it.

### Credits

Huge majority of the wallpapers here I got from the r/unixporn Discord server: https://discord.gg/TnJ4h5K
