# Wallpapers
These are all the wallpapers I have collected. Dont ask why I have so many anime wallpapers 

# Installation

Linux:

If you have `git` installed, you can go into a terminal and do: `git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers.git`

If you dont have `git` you can either just download this repo as a .zip folder, or install `git` from your distro's package manager (eg: apt, dnf, pacman, yum, zypper, xpbs, and so on), and then do the command above.

Windows:

If you have the git bash installed you can do: `git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers.git` 

If you dont have that installed, you can just download this repo as a .zip folder (or install git bash and run the command, up to you).


Huge majority of the wallpapers here I got from the r/unixporn discord server.
