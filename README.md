# Wallpapers
These are all the wallpapers I have collected. Dont ask why I have so many anime wallpapers 

# Installation

### Linux:

If you have `git` installed, you can go into a terminal and run: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers.git
```

If you dont have `git` you can either just download this repo as a .zip folder, or install `git` from your distro's package manager (eg: `apt-get`, `yum`, `pacman`, `zypper`, etc.), and then run the command above.

### Windows:

If you have [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed you can run: 
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/Wallpapers.git
```

If you dont have that installed, you can just download this repo as a .zip folder (or install git bash and run the command, up to you).


Huge majority of the wallpapers here I got from the r/unixporn discord server: https://discord.gg/TnJ4h5K
